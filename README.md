### Some neat Excel tricks:

* Use the ```$``` sign button in 'Number' tab to format currencies
* Use ```$``` in a formula to make an absolute cell reference instead relative reference (see assn3 - pay)
* Use 'Increase/Decrease' Decimal buttons in 'Number' tab to display numbers accordingly
* Use ```=``` sign to create a function to generate a calculated cell with results
* Examples functions: ```MAX``` ```MIN``` ```SUM``` ```AVERAGE``` 
* You can copy/paste a calculated cell to perform the same function operation on a different cell
* ```ESC``` cancels any changes that might have been made while editing the cell

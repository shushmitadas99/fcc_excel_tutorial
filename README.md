### Some neat Excel tricks:

* Use the ```$``` sign button in 'Number' tab to format currencies
* Use ```$``` in a formula to make an absolute cell reference instead relative reference (see assn3 - pay)
* Use 'Increase/Decrease' Decimal buttons in 'Number' tab to display numbers accordingly
* Use ```=``` sign to create a function to generate a calculated cell with results
* Examples functions: ```max``` ```min``` ```sum``` ```average``` 
* You can copy/paste a calculated cell to perform the same function operation on a different cell
* ```ESC``` cancels any changes that might have been made while editing the cell
* Use ```text to columns``` function to split first and last names from one to two individual columns
* Use ```sumif``` to add items togethger based on a condition
* We use ```sort``` and ```filter``` functions for common database operations on Excel
* Pivot table is a way to summarize a large group of data
* ```vlookup``` table only works when the table is alphabetized, so we need to sort it
